# Variables, Operators & Assignments
## Variables
<p>Variables are containers for storing data values. They are used to label and store information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords.</p>

<ul><li><strong>var</strong> is the traditional way of declaring variables in JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong>let</strong> allows you to declare variables that can be reassigned.</li>
<li><strong>const</strong> declares variables with constant values, which cannot be reassigned.</li></ul>
<p>Naming Convention: Variable names can consist of letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. They must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. Variable names are case-sensitive.

Scope: Variables can have local or global scope. Variables declared inside a function are local to that function, while variables declared outside any function have global scope.

Hoisting: In JavaScript, variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope during compilation. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.</p>


## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators 

<p>Arithmetic Operators are used to perform mathematical calculations.</p>

<p>Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulus (%).</p>

  
### Assignment Operators

<p>Assignment Operators are used to assign values to variables.</p>

<p>Simple assignment (=), Addition assignment (+=), Subtraction assignment (-=), etc.</p>


### Comparison Operators

<p>Comparaison Operators are used to compare values.</p>

Equal to (==), Not equal to (!=), Greater than (>), Less than (<), etc.
Logical Operators: Used to combine and manipulate logical expressions.

Logical AND (&&), Logical OR (||), Logical NOT (!).

### Bitwise Operators 

<p>Bitwise Operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers.</p>

Bitwise AND (&), Bitwise OR (|), Bitwise XOR (^), Bitwise NOT (~), etc.

<h3>Unary Operators</h3>: Operates on a single operand.

Increment (++), Decrement (--).

<h3>Ternary Operator</h3>: A conditional operator that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.

Syntax: condition ? value1 : value2
