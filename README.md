## Variables, Operators & Assignments
# Variables
<p>Variables are containers for storing data values. They are used to label and store information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords.</p>

<ul><li><strong>var</strong> is the traditional way of declaring variables in JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong>let</strong> allows you to declare variables that can be reassigned.</li>
<li><strong>const</strong> declares variables with constant values, which cannot be reassigned.</li></ul>
<p>Naming Convention: Variable names can consist of letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. They must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. Variable names are case-sensitive.

Scope: Variables can have local or global scope. Variables declared inside a function are local to that function, while variables declared outside any function have global scope.

Hoisting: In JavaScript, variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope during compilation. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.</>
